## 🏁 Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/car-service-server.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file:

   ```env
   PORT="3000"

   # Database
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/car_service"

   # JWT
   JWT_SECRET="your_secret_key"
   JWT_EXPIRES="1h"
   ```

   ```

5. Start development mode:

   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

## 🏗️ Build (Production)

Compile TypeScript into JavaScript:

```bash
npm run build
```

The compiled output will be generated inside the `dist/` directory.

---

## 🚀 Start (Production)

After building:

```bash
npm start
```

Or run directly:

```bash
node dist/main.js
```

---

## 🔐 Security Note: Script Folder Access

The `scripts/` directory contains development‑only utilities such as the **Prisma Sync Script**.  
These scripts **must not** be executed in production environments.

### ✔️ Recommended Production Setup

- Disable execution permissions for the `scripts` folder on production servers
- Or exclude the folder entirely during CI/CD or Docker builds
- Ensure only trusted developers can run these scripts locally

This prevents accidental or unauthorized execution of sensitive operations.
